                Summary of my learnings in managing covid. See what you can apply.



                Though everything I say is based on my reading of scientific literature and results of Artificial
                Intelligence predictive models I am not a doctor so please listen to your doctor if he contradicts
                anything I say. <br> <br>

                The virus is airborne and whatever precautions you take you still run a risk of contracting the disease.
                So do all you can to minimise probability by wearing a mask and washing your hands before touching your
                face. If you must interact with others try to do so outdoors. If indoors keep air purifiers on because
                they circulate air through hepa filters. Also keep exhaust fans on wherever available. <br> <br>

                If you have to take a flight the most dangerous place is the airport and in the aircraft before take off
                and after landing. During the flight air is circulated through hepa filters and a mix from outside air
                so you are relatively safe. <br> <br>

                The key is to think of how to boost your immune system to fight of the virus and to ensure it doesn’t do
                too much harm even if you get infected. <br> <br>

                I would approach boosting immunity in two parts ... boosting your defences against viruses ... and then
                also up regulating your immune system to fight off opportunistic secondary infections. <br> <br>

            </div>
            <div class="flex items-center lg:w-3/5 mx-auto border-b pb-10 mb-10 border-gray-200 sm:flex-row flex-col">
                First have the vaccine that’s available as soon as you are eligible. They all work. Side effects are
                greatly exaggerated. They may not prevent you from catching the infection but they do protect you from
                dying from it. Regular exercise increases the efficacy of all these vaccines. <br> <br>

                Minimum seven and a half hours of sleep will ensure your nk cells operate at their optimum ( five hours
                or less on a single night and their efficacy falls by 40 percent ) <br> <br>

                Nutritional yeast ( I recommend Bragg’s ) unregulates your production of monocytes. Eat a tea spoon a
                day by adding to salads etc. Also seems to enhance mood as a side effect. <br> <br>

                Mushrooms also significantly boost Immunoglobulin A and should be consumed regularly.
                <br> <br>
                Mushrooms also have a strong anti inflammatory effect so that’s just a extra beneficial side effect <br>
                <br>

                Consuming raw Broccoli sprouts ideally but broccoli and or all other cruciferous vegetables like cabbage
                , cauliflower etc provide you with precursors to sulphorophanes which are hugely protective against
                pathogens. If you cook them then just garnish with raw mustard seeds before consuming. <br> <br>

            </div>
            <div class="flex items-center lg:w-3/5 mx-auto sm:flex-row flex-col">
               
                All berries .. blueberries have been extensively tested boost your nk cell activity so I would include
                them in my regular diet <br> <br>
                Kale which is very closely related to Broccoli also helps clear dioxins and boost your immune response
                <br> <br>

                Cardamom ( which you should always wash before consuming to remove pesticide residue ) boosts the
                efficacy of nk cells by ten times ... strongest natural booster of efficacy of these cells been found to
                date. Black pepper also boosts nk cell activity. <br> <br>
                The two combined magnify each other’s efforts. Garlic helps clear out lots of opportunistic bacteria
                from lungs. <br> <br>

                A whole host of Probiotics have been seen to boost natural immune response though mechanisms are not
                fully understood. But better than eating any tablets is to eat fermented millets ( without heating) Most
                commercially available probiotics don’t work as per a recent Israeli study. <br> <br>

                Amla has huge immune system boosting powers ... so does green tea. I would include these as part of my
                regimen. <br> <br>

                Eating less times a day will not harm you .. in fact it may do the opposite . ... Front load your
                calories to the earlier part of the day and flow natural circadian rhythms. Your gut microbiome will be
                grateful and confer better immune protection <br> <br>

                Aloe and aloe juice is one more food I would add to protect myself since it is known to inhibit flu
                viruses from adheasing to lung tissue. <br> <br>
            </div>

                Frequent use of sauna is also know to offer protection against pneumonia so should be incorporated if
                possible. If not steaming ( done carefully with some distance so as not to scald your bronchial tissue)
                would help.

                Selenium deficiency often makes one more susceptible to viral attacks. So add one Brazil nut once a week
                or some pumpkin seeds will do the job ... (we need very little selenium) <br><br>

                Kiwi fruit has been found to reduce the intensity and duration of viral infections of the pneumatic
                system so eating it twice a week will help. <br><br>

                Eating two pods of raw garlic every day will prevent secondary infections in the lungs. <br><br>

                Since covid leads to blood clot issues I would recommend having a spoonful of turmeric with a pinch of
                black pepper everyday. Garlic also helps.
                <br><br>
                Covid messes with sugar metabolism and release and so do steroids if you end up needing them. <br><br>

                Hence eating soaked (overnight) fenugreek ( Methi) seeds along with drinking the water in which they are
                soaked will aid your body in reviving its balance. <br><br>

                I would also recommend a large doze of vitamin d too
                60,000 iu. ( most of us are deficient and being deficient vitamin D would hamper our immunity.) After
                fifteen days I would switch to eating 4000 iu per day . <br><br>

                Do brhamari or else the extended humming after using thumbs to close ears to concentrate nitrous oxide
                in Nasal cavity.

                Lye on your stomach with two pillows under your hip and one under your upper chest. Lie on your sides
                too. This expands the surface area available for respiration. <br><br>

                Start monitoring your oxygen saturation. It’s very important to keep doing so even after the fever has
                dissipated for at least a week. <br><br>

                If ct value is over 24 you will not be infectious to others but still take every precaution. <br><br>

                The normal regimen for people with normal weight is <br><br>

                Tab Favipiravir (Favmac)
                200 mg <br>
                Day 1 : 9 tabs twice a day <br>
                Day 2 onwards till day 7: 4 tabs twice a day ( clinical data shows weak but some efficacy. Since there <br>
                are minimal side effects it’s worth including in regimen.) <br><br>

                Tab Ivermectin <br>
                12 mg <br>
                At bedtime x 3 days <br>

                Most doctors prescribe a antibiotic like doxy cycline (100 mg twice a day for five days or Azithromycin
                ( 500 mg once a day for five days ) but quite frankly if you have two freshly chopped pods of raw garlic
                and you don’t have any other secondary issue you shouldn’t need it. <br><br>

                Inhaled Budesonide ( an asthma medicine ) reduces risk that the disease will become more serious.
                <br><br>

                Eat any zinc supplement
                Zinconia. Is a common and easily available zinc supplement Have one a day for two weeks. My personal
                preference is to eat a few cashews daily instead. <br><br>

                Have paracetamol if fever goes to 102/103 if it’s lower don’t interfere with your fever. Interferon
                production and efficacy increases with higher body temperature and it’s useful in fighting virus load
                <br><br>

                Following tests to be done after 7 days if any discomfort / fever persists. If symptom free and oxygen
                saturation above 94 then measure your oxygen saturation after a six minute walk inside your room. If the
                saturation falls by 4 percent or more than still do the following tests.
                <br><br>
                CBC, ESR, CRP, LFT, KFT, uric acid, Ferritin levels, D dimer, CK, CK-MB, Trop I, Pro BNP, Interleukin 6,
                HbA1c, HRCT thorax. If liver enzyme Alt ( alanine amino transferase ) ,ferritin ,haemoglobin are high
                and or there is myalgia ( deep muscle pain ) or you have been a cancer patient or suffer from a neuro
                degenerative disease I would be extra vigilant and search out more intensive medical resources including
                availability of oxygen and potentially access to a hospital. <br><br>

                Keep these following medicine at home. Do not start eating any. Only eat if oxygen saturation starts
                dropping below 90 .. if you eat get to a hospital <br><br>

                1) stanozol 2 mg ( goes by the brand name .. neuro bal ( dosage is 3 times a day with full glass of
                water ) <br><br>

                If hospitalised or oxygen saturation falls then breathing exercises , lying on your stomach ( with
                pillows ) and humming all help. <br><br>

                Remdesvir , plasma therapy etc have no efficacy ( I’ve read loads of clinical trial data )and am
                perplexed as to why they are prescribed other than the human instinct of trying something. <br><br>

                Steroids ( usually dexmethazone and or methyl prednisone )work very well but do not self administer. If
                had to early they will suppress the fight against infections. Make sure you have these only under
                medical supervision. <br><br>
               
            </div>
            <div class="flex items-center lg:w-3/5 mx-auto sm:flex-row flex-col">
               
                At that juncture doctors usually prescribe an anti coagulant like heparin etc. Do tell the doctor about
                your consumption of turmeric and garlic as they are both blood thinners and maybe the doctor might chose
                to modify dosage. <br><br>

                The general perception is that in covid 19 and or covid 21 only the respiratory tract is involved but
                this is not true. That is where the symptoms are most acute. <br><br>

                The reality is that the spike protein bonds with Ace2 receptors. These are embedded in virtually all
                membranes but have the highest density in the lungs , heart , blood vessels, brain ,gut,other organs ...
                hence it causes inflammation and different kinds of inflammations and sub optimal functioning in these
                organs which may or may not be symptomatic. <br><br>

                Hence you hear of sudden cardiac arrests in patients whose lung functions etc have normalised. This
                dangerous effect can last for about three months after the acute symptomatic phase of the disease. In
                this period it is best not to stress your system. Do ambling walks , yoga , stretches etc . Let your
                system recover. Don’t attempt to do intense exercises. <br><br>
